# GoogleAPITesting
The main purpose of this repository is to get familiar with Google's API for Google Sheets, by using the gspread and oauth2client libraries.
The end goal is to build a desktop app with a GUI (using the wxPython library) for internal use that can access, save, process, do a statistical analysis and display graphical information from data introduced through Google Forms.

All resources and libraries used will be publicly available, preferably of open-source nature.
